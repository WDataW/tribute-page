            Combs is a father to seven children. His first biological child, a son, Justin, was born in 1993 to fashion designer and stylist Misa Hylton. He attended UCLA on a football scholarship and graduated in 2016. Combs had an on-again, off-again relationship with Kimberly Porter (1970–2018), which lasted from 1994 to 2007. He raised and adopted Quincy, born 1991, Porter's son from a previous relationship with singer-producer and Combs's rival, Al B. Sure!. Together, they had a son, Christian, born 1998, and twin daughters, born 2006. Porter died of pneumonia on November 15, 2018
            Five months before the birth of his twins, Combs had a daughter, born to Sarah Chapman. He took legal responsibility for her in October 2007. Combs was in an 11-year relationship with Cassie Ventura from 2007 to 2018. Combs's seventh child was born on October 15, 2022, a daughter. Her mother is Dana Tran.
            In November 2022, Combs and his second-eldest son became the first father-son duo to have simultaneous No. 1 hits. Combs reached the top of the Billboard Adult R&B Airplay chart with "Gotta Move On", while his son, under his stage name King Combs, topped Mediabase's US Urban Radio chart with "Can't Stop Won't Stop", featuring Kodak Black.
            Combs owns a home in Alpine, New Jersey, which he purchased for $7 million. In 2018 Combs bought Past Times, a 1997 painting by Kerry James Marshall for $21 million, establishing a record for a painting by a living black artist.

          <p>Combs became an intern at New York's Uptown Records. While talent director at Uptown, he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige. In his college days Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants. In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.
            In 1993, after being fired from Uptown, Combs established his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as a joint venture with Arista Records, taking then-newcomer The Notorious B.I.G. with him.[17][18] Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total,[19] and Father MC. The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others. Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Notorious B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade...

          </header>
          <p>
            On November 16, 2023, Combs's ex girlfirend Casandra "Cassie" Ventura filed a $30 million sexual assault lawsuit against him, alleging that he subjected her to a decade-long “cycle of abuse, violence and sex trafficking.” Cassie claimed that this included a 2018 rape after she tried to leave him, and multiple instances of domestic violence. Combs's attorney has denied the allegation. The lawsuit would be settled the day after it was filed. However, at least two more sexual assault-related lawsuits would soon follow, which led to Combs stepping down as head of Revolt TV on November 28, 2023.
